# Introduction

The main objective of the FAIR-X project is to promote systematic reporting of sex and gender in research and foster diversity in biomedical practices. The European Commission, NIH and other institutions aim to make sex and gender analysis mandatory in the research and its policy would apply to all disciplines. 
 We understand sex as the biological characteristics commonly used to classify people as male, female or intersex, and gender as socially constructed roles, norms and identities, not necessarily binary or aligned with a person’s sex. This survey wants to observe the awareness of domain experts regarding these two variables in biomedical research, as well as their attitude towards capturing diversity including other dimensions of intersectionality such as age, race or ethnicity. 
Science could benefit from diversity: to improve the participation of under-represented groups is not just fairer, it could produce better research practices and outcomes. We can make a change, we can have a better science! 

1. How often do you include the following variables in your dataset? 
   Sex: Never (0) - 1- 2- 3- 4- 5 (Always)
   Gender: Never (0) - 1- 2- 3- 4- 5 (Always)
   Age: Never (0) - 1- 2- 3- 4- 5 (Always)
   Ethnicity: Never (0) - 1- 2- 3- 4- 5 (Always)
   Race: Never (0) - 1- 2- 3- 4- 5 (Always)
   
2. Does your interpretation of results includes a intersectional analysis (sex, Gender, Age, Ethnicity, Race)
   Yes
   No
   N/A
  
3. Are you familiarised with guidelines or recommendations of best practices in biomedical research? (DOME: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01205-4; SAGER: )
  I don't know them
  I know them but I don't apply them
  I know them but I don't need them
  I know them but I don't agree with them
  I know them and I use them
  I know others: ...
  N/A
  
4. Do you think capturing diversity (e.g., sex, gender, age, ethnicity) for biomedical research must be:
  Mandatory 
  Not Mandatory 
  I don´t know 
  N/A
  
5. How much do you consider the diversity (e.g., sex, gender, age, ethnicity) for biomedical research in your analysis:
  Not relevant 
  Extremely Relevant 
  I don´t know 
  N/A
  
6. Would you be interested in receiving training on social and ethical implications of biomedical research?
  Yes
  No
  I don't know

7. Have you experienced difficulties with datasets having many missing values of diversity data due to data donnors withdrawing (parts of) informed consent?
  Never
  Sometimes
  Often
  Always
  NA

8. Do you think educating data donnors would help raising awareness on the importance of diversity data for fair research outcomes?
 1 Not helpful 
 2
 3
 4
 5 Extremely helpful 
 
9. The European Commision has published a Gender equality plan to opt for research fundings. Also the Gendered Innovation published a report recommending how to introduce the sex and gender dimension in biomedical research.
-- add one line about editorial power -- How important is to include diversity information in publication and funding processes?
  Not important
  Important only for publications and Intellectual Property 
  Important only for fundings
  Important for both
  Neither
  Others: ...

10. Which mechanisms should be put in place to ensure that public and private biomedical research capture diversity dimension? (multiple answers)
  Self-assessment
  International Standards
  Codes of conduct
  Legal regulation
  Editorial policy requirements
  Requirements by funding bodies
  Regulated bodies (e.g., FDA, EMA (spain AEMPS))
  All
  None
  Others: ...
